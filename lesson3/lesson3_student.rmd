```{r Faceting Friend Count}
# What code would you add to create a facet the histogram by gender?
# Add it to the code below.
qplot(x = friend_count, data = pf, binwidth = 10) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000),
                     breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50))

Response:

***

### Tenure
Notes:

```{r Tenure}
qplot(x = tenure, data = pf, binwidth = 10,
      color = I('black'), fill = I('#099DD9'))
```

***

#### How would you create a histogram of tenure by year?

```{r Tenure Histogram by Year}
qplot(x = tenure/365, data = pf, binwidth = 0.25,
      color = I('black'), fill = I('#099DD9'))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,7,1),lim=c(0,7))
```

***

### Labeling Plots
Notes:

```{r Labeling Plots}
qplot(x = tenure/365, data = pf, binwidth = 0.25,
      xlab = 'Number of years using Facebook',
      ylab = 'Number of users in sample',
      color = I('black'), fill = I('#099DD9'))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,7,1),lim=c(0,7))
```

***

### User Ages
Notes:

```{r User Ages}
qplot(x = age, data = pf, binwidth = 1,
      xlab = 'Ages of users using Facebook',
      ylab = 'Number of users in sample',
      color = I('black'), fill = I('#099DD9'))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(10,115,5),lim=c(10,115))
```

#### What do you notice?

### Transforming Data
Notes:
```{r Add a Scaling Layer}
p1 <- qplot(x = friend_count, data = pf, binwidth = 100)+scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,2000,400),limits = c(0,2000))
p2 <- qplot(x = friend_count, data = pf)+scale_x_log10(limits = c(1,2000))
p3 <- qplot(x = friend_count, data = pf)+scale_x_sqrt(limits = c(1,2000))
grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3,ncol=1)
```
***

### Add a Scaling Layer
Notes:

```{r Add a Scaling Layer}

```

***


### Frequency Polygons

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=6}
qplot(x = friend_count, y = ..count../sum(..count..), binwidth = 10, 
       data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)),geom='freqpoly',color=gender) + 
       #geom_freqpoly(aes(color = gender), binwidth=10) + 
       scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 500), breaks = seq(0, 500, 25)) + 
       xlab('Likes Count') + 
       ylab('Percentage of users with that likes count')
```

***

### Likes on the Web
Notes:

```{r,fig.width=10,fig.height=5}
qplot(x = www_likes, y = ..density.., data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)),
          geom = 'freqpoly', color = gender) + 
       #scale_x_continuous() + 
       scale_x_log10() +
       xlab('Likes Count') + 
       ylab('Percentage of users with that likes count') 

by(pf$www_likes,pf$gender,sum)
```


***

### Box Plots
Notes:

```{r Box Plots}
qplot(x = gender, y = friend_count, 
      data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)), geom = 'boxplot')
```

#### Adjust the code to focus on users who have friend counts between 0 and 1000.

```{r}
qplot(x = gender, y = friend_count, 
      data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)), geom = 'boxplot') + coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,1000))
```

***

### Box Plots, Quartiles, and Friendships
Notes:

```{r Box Plots, Quartiles, and Friendships}
qplot(x = gender, y = friend_count, 
      data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)), geom = 'boxplot') + coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,250))

by(pf$friend_count,pf$gender,summary)
```

#### On average, who initiated more friendships in our sample: men or women?
Response:
#### Write about some ways that you can verify your answer.
Response:
```{r Friend Requests by Gender}
qplot(x = gender, y = friendships_initiated, 
      data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)), geom = 'boxplot') + coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,250))

by(pf$friendships_initiated,pf$gender,summary)
```

Response: Women have initiated more friendships. Plotting the boxplot graph we can see that the median and 1st/3rd quartiles are slightly higher for women than they are for men. Taking a closer look through an aggregation function, we can see that the median women initiated 49 friendships versus 44 for men.

***

### Getting Logical
Notes:

```{r Getting Logical}
pf$mobile_check_in <- ifelse(pf$mobile_likes > 0,1,0)
pf$mobile_check_in <- factor(pf$mobile_check_in)
nrow(pf[pf$mobile_check_in == 1,])/nrow(pf)
```

Response:
